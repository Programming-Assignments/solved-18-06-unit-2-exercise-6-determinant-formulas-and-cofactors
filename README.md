<strong>Problem</strong> <strong>19.1:</strong> Compute the determinant of:




<em>A</em>                              <sup>⎥</sup><sub>⎥ </sub>.

0     1          0          0

Which method of computing the determinant do you prefer for this problem, and why?

<strong>Problem</strong> <strong>19.2:</strong> (5.2 #33. <em>Introduction</em> <em>to</em> <em>Linear</em> <em>Algebra:</em> Strang) The symmetric Pascal matrices have determinant 1. If I subtract 1 from the <em>n</em>, <em>n</em> entry, why does the determinant become zero? (Use rule 3 or cofactors.)




<sup>⎡ </sup>1 1 1 1 ⎤
